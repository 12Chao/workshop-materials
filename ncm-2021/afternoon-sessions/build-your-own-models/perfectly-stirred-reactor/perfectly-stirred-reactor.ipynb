    "\n",
    "The perfectly stirred reactor (aka \"PSR\") is defined by a relatively simple set of governing equations, providing an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how we can use Cantera as a \"calculator\" to provide the terms and variables required for solving a set of equations of our own choosing.\n",

Note that we could use some combination of mass/mole fractions and pressure or total mass density.
