The so-called *stoichiometric* methods, on the other hand (including the Gibbs minimization), require solving $K$ nonlinear equations, where $K$ is the number of species (usually $K >> M$). See Smith and Missen's \"Chemical Reaction Equilibrium Analysis\" for more information on the various algorithms and their characteristics.\n",
